Open Food Facts Server
====================

Open Food Facts / Open Beauty Facts database and web interface.

Placeholder for the code of the Open Food Facts / Open Beauty Facts backends (database, web interface, API etc.).
Efforts are under way to clean and open the code which is currently in a private repository.
